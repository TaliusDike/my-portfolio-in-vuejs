## My Portfolio in Vue JS

Using Vue JS, I built a portfolio website to showcase my journey so far as a Frontend Software Engineer.

The website is simple and bears links to my GitHub repository and some of the hosted applications I've built. It's also equipped with media query functionality to properly adapt to mobile and web screen sizes. 

Checkout the deployed website [HERE](https://taliusdev1-portfolio.netlify.app/). I welcome helpful comments to further improve its look and feel.
